## LIBFT

#### First project of the 42 common core, here we create tools (some of them already exists in C libs) to support us throughout the course, in addition to greatly improving the programming logic, which is also the main focus of this project.

#### The libft bonus is a kickstart to learning the linked list universe.

#### Its important to understand the objective of the tools inside "source" and "bonus" directories to use them.

## USAGE

#### This Makefile command will compile all C files and build "libft.a" wich can be compiled with other C programs for the tooling usage.

```
