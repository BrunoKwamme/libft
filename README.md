## LIBFT

#### First project of the 42 common core, here we create tools (some of them already exists in C libs) to support us throughout the course, in addition to greatly improving the programming logic, which is also the main focus of this project.

#### The libft bonus is a kickstart to learning the linked list universe.

#### It is important to understand the purpose of the tools within the "source" and "bonus" directories in order to use them.

## USAGE

#### This Makefile command will compile all C files and build "libft.a" wich can be compiled with other C programs for the tooling usage.
```
make
```

#### This command will compile the bonus inside the "libft.a" build.
```
make bonus
```

#### Use this command to clean all the objects and "libft.a" build.
```
make fclean
```
